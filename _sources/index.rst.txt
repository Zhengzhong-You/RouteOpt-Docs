RouteOpt is a comprehensive framework designed for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) exactly. Built upon leading commercial solvers such as **Gurobi**, **CPLEX**, and **MindOpt**, RouteOpt provides extensive functionalities including:

- **Rank-1 Cuts**: Tools for cut generation, separation, reduced-cost updates in labeling, coefficient calculations, and more.
- **Rounded Capacity Cuts**: Similar functionalities specifically tailored for rounded capacity cuts.
- **Branching Module**: A state-of-the-art branching selection mechanism.
- **Deluxing Package**: Aggressively reduces enumerated columns, significantly enhancing solver performance.


Development History
-------------------

RouteOpt was initiated by Zhengzhong (Ricky) You in 2021 during his PhD studies at UF ISE, under the guidance of Dr. Yu Yang. Initially intended to facilitate research on learning-based branching techniques, RouteOpt filled a gap left by the absence of fully open-source software meeting these needs.

The initial release of RouteOpt focused exclusively on solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). However, early versions faced challenges such as extensive code nesting, which hindered usability and slowed development. Recognizing these barriers, RouteOpt was restructured into modular components, providing significant improvements:

- **Easy Onboarding**: Streamlined structure for quicker adoption by new users.
- **Rapid Development**: Modular design allows faster enhancements and extensions.
- **Flexible Usage**: Independent use of modules without deep familiarity with implementation details.

RouteOpt lowers the complexity of creating exact VRP solvers, fostering a more accessible environment for research and application.


Motivation and Inspiration
--------------------------

RouteOpt was primarily inspired by the necessity for accessible software to implement "Learning to Branch" methodologies. By addressing this need, RouteOpt not only provides a practical solution but also encourages the adoption and further development of these advanced branching techniques within the research community.


Commitment to Development and Maintenance
-----------------------------------------

Special acknowledgment goes to the creators and contributors of **VRPSolver** (`vrpsolver.math.u-bordeaux.fr <https://vrpsolver.math.u-bordeaux.fr/>`_), whose pioneering contributions have significantly influenced RouteOpt’s design and performance standards.

While RouteOpt exhibits advantages over VRPSolver, particularly for CVRP and VRPTW problems, there remain numerous opportunities for improvement:

- Extending solver support to additional VRP variants.
- Enhancing scalability, adaptability, and flexibility.
- Reducing parameter sensitivity and increasing overall stability.

These challenges represent exciting opportunities for community collaboration, ensuring RouteOpt’s continual growth into a top-tier VRP solver.

RouteOpt is committed to building on previous foundational work, driving advancements in vehicle routing research, and empowering both researchers and practitioners.
