Install
=======

This guide is for building RouteOpt on Linux only.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C/C++ compiler.
- **Ninja** build system. Install it using:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install ninja-build

  Ninja is used (for example, with Xgboost).

- **Gurobi**: Make sure Gurobi is installed and note its installation path. This path will be used in the following steps.
  **Important**: Enter the full path to the Linux64 folder (e.g., ``/home/yzz/gurobi1000/linux64``), not just the parent directory.

Installation Steps
------------------
1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open a terminal and run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/RouteOpt.git

2. **Change Directory**
   Navigate to the cloned repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd RouteOpt

3. **Build RouteOpt**
   Run the build script:

   .. code-block:: python

      python build.py

4. **Specify Gurobi Path**
   When prompted, enter the full path to your Gurobi installation, for example:

      /home/yzz/gurobi1000/linux64

5. **Build RouteOpt**
   The build process may take about 3 minutes to complete. Once finished, you should see the message:

   ``Build process completed successfully.``

   This indicates that all packages have been built successfully.

Building CVRP or TW Solver
---------------------------
If you want to use our CVRP or TW solver:

1. Change directory to the application package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd packages/application/cvrp

2. Run the build script:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sh build.sh

3. The script will compile the CVRP or TW solver and run a small test instance (P-n20-k2.vrp). If the test succeeds, you are all set!

Conclusion
----------
After following these steps, RouteOpt and all required packages should be built successfully.
Enjoy optimizing your routing problems with RouteOpt!
